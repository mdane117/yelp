For my drink, I chose the jasmine tea soda. I liked the soda as it was a never seen before twist on the classic jasmine tea. The hot and sour soup that came with the sando meal was just okay. I really enjoyed my honey Hawthorne chicken sandwich and would recommend this item if you like food items that are both sweet and savory. The other person who I was with, on the other hand, said they did not really like the combination and would rather have a pineapple bun and American fried chicken sandwich on its own separately, so the combination of sweet and savory tastes of this sandwich may not be for everyone!<br><br>The staff was really sweet and helpful when ordering, which was really nice. The inside and decor feels retro yet fun at the same time, what I would imagine to be the vibes of an 80s/90s Chinese diner.

It really is a vehicle to eat with other saucy dishes.<br>- Lazy Chicken: Pretty good, crispy chicken but what throws me off is the cold sour cauliflower. know it&#39;s meant to be a contrast to the fatty chicken, but I think it&#39;s too stark of a difference. Marked on the menu as three chili&#39;s worth of spice, but really is not that bad. The size of the dish leaves much to be desired.<br>- Mapo Tofu: something was just off for this dish, my friend saying it tasted more like gravy though I personally thought it tasted more like a pasta sauce. It was really sweet- also came way after we had finished the other dishes we ordered, so I asked for a takeout container for it. I received a paper takeout container, and as expected the sauce leaked through the box.<br><br>I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s the best food, nor the best dining experience, but I would come back to try the soft serve.

I had been wanted to come here since it opened, which was just before the start of the pandemic.

When I worked in downtown SF at that Asset Mgt firm, I met a few girlfriends who are either Chinese or Canadian Chinese. It was the beginning of my new life as I hardly had any Asian friends. They introduced me (rather re-introduced me) to Chinese American food in San Francisco, which evoked many of my childhood and teenage memories.

It&#39;s my second love. My first love was of course Chinese American SF chinatown food which I grew up on. It reminded me of my childhood and early 20s. The food is nothing like Chinese food, it has its own unique Cantonese and gold rush roots. It&#39;s so different from any other Chinese American food you find in New York, that it&#39;s in and itself a cuisine, and few have executed as well as Mamahuhu. As an aside, whenever I spent a long time in Asia including China, I would go to Chinatown as soon a I get back, to get take out food a it&#39;s an unique San Francisco cuisine and it reminded me of home.<br><br>Is it worth spending $20 for your Kungpao chicken with fried rice and egg roll?

What I really enjoyed is that the dish did not turn soggy near the end of the meal and stayed pretty damn crisp (relative to how natural sogginess occurs in real time while chillin in sauce). The pineapple pieces were charred which was a nice touch and the veggies were crunchy. <br><br>Sesame Noodle - this was good but a little boring. The noodles tasted similar to soba. Maybe it is buckwheat based and I missed seeing that in the menu. I would like more chili oil but that&#39;s personal preference. <br><br>Mapo Tofu - I&#39;m gonna be picky about this one y&#39;all. I love mapo tofu. I would eat buckets of this if I could stomach it but then I&#39;d vomit to death which means no more meals. I would say this isn&#39;t the worst I&#39;d had but it was a lil boring. It fell flat for me and I wish there was more punch to it. Could use more peppercorns or something. It wasn&#39;t very flavorful as the ones I had where my palette is thanking the shit out of me. <br><br>Beef and Broccoli - good seasoning, good beef, veggies were cooked super well (bright green with crunch) but hmmm it was okay. I wonder how the mushrooms would taste.

The Kung Pao Chicken was just as explosive, made with chunks of free-range chicken, mala peanuts, chili, peppers, celery, and my favorite element, smoked tofu, which to me tasted just like ham! Both of these dishes went really well with the Jasmine rice we ordered on the side, and though the prices of the dishes weren&#39;t cheap when compared to any old Chinese takeout, the portion sizes were quite generous, and the value was definitely worth it for the quality ingredients!<br><br>For an adventurous take on Chinese food in one of the most interesting settings you&#39;ll find at a &#34;Chinese&#34; restaurant, look no further than average-old Mamahuhu!",359,10,150

I swear, I didn&#39;t see any discernable shrimps, even after putting on reading glasses!  Note that for $10.00, you&#39;re getting a smaller sized Chinese take-out container of rice than you would at most other Chinese restaurants.<br><br>***Jasmine Rice ($4.00)***<br>Complimentary, thanks!  Standard white rice.  <br><br>***Overall Pricing***<br>Yes, it&#39;s definitely less expensive than Mr. Jiu&#39;s, but they&#39;re serving completely different food here.  How can you compare a whole salt-baked fish from Mr. Jiu&#39;s to sweet and sour pork at Mamahuhu&#39;s?  You can&#39;t.  At Mamahuhu&#39;s, it&#39;s basic Chinese food in a smaller and very casual setting.  It&#39;s really an unfair comparison.   I don&#39;t at all mind spending $$$$$ on food​​ if I feel I&#39;m getting good value in return.  I appreciate the organic pork and some of the supposedly better quality ingredients.  However, I&#39;m not sure that the overall food quality and smaller portions overall equate with the pricing.  I&#39;ll feel much better about paying premium pricing if they clearly specify where their meats, poultry and vegetables are being locally sourced from. Grass-fed​? Pasteur Raised?  Certified Organic? Non-GMO verified? <br><br>Going the Caviar route will definitely cost a pretty penny!  For 3 items, my final tally was $57.75.  That would equate to $19.25 per item, and one of those items was fried rice​.  I wouldn&#39;t currently recommend this given the limited​ options available on the menu, coupled with how the food held up. <br><br>Admittedly, I&#39;ve lowered my expectations around Mamahuhu, after having actually tried their food.  I still plan to go, ​in hopes that I&#39;ll be a fan of other items I haven&#39;t yet tried.  I&#39;m also hoping that there&#39;ll be less of a mismatch between the overall quality, portion size,​ and cost ​​than there was with my experience via Caviar.  Fingers crossed!",359,10,160

It was $5 but pretty interesting to try. If it was that experience alone, I would&#39;ve gave a 5 star rating but I waited since I wanted to try at least one of their house special. Today I did just that and I opted for their sweet &amp; sour chicken since it seemed to be the most popular dish here. The lunch box came with the chicken, their wok veggies, and white rice. There was an option to add an egg roll for $2 so I did that. Total was $18.02 so a bit pricey in my opinion. Initially, the first piece of chicken was pretty good. It was crispy and flavorful but the more I had everything, I struggled to finish it. At first I was a bit disappointed with the portion size of the chicken but I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t get a lot.

Never in my life have I had to experience the atrocity that I had to experience today. <br><br>I walked in to order the lunch special, with such high hopes for the restaurant in terms of not only food, but customer service. The food was mid, nothing special. Very average and tasted exactly like Panda Express. <br><br>What makes me give this restaurant a 1 star review, is the customer service. I expected to simply order takeout, pay, then leave. But instead, things went completely wrong when I spoke with the cashier, whom was a female. <br><br>She kept asking me AT LEAST 5 times if there was &#34;anything else I wanted&#34; after I ordered my lunch special. I said no the first time, she asked twice. I said no a second time, she asked a third time. I continued to say no and she continued to ask me. <br><br>I just am wondering where and when this employee thought it was ever okay to have the audacity to act like a customers business did not matter by asking them repeatedly if &#34;there was anything else they wanted&#34; after the customer clearly wanted the lunch special only. Her intention was not to make sure I was taken care of. Her intention was to tell me that the lunch special was the one thing on the menu that was low priced, and that I as a customer should order more from the menu in order to be appreciated as a customer. <br><br>I could eat wherever I want, it DOES NOT HAVE TO be here. Yet I chose this place to have lunch, and expected basic appreciation because the lunch special is still a valid order, and any business at any price should be appreciated. The cashier and the employees acted as though I OWE them to order more from the menu, when they know for a fact that I don&#39;t have to eat here at all. No one does. Clement has EXTREMELY high quality restaurants that serve WAY better food and have WAY more respectful employees. Yet the cashier had the audacity to act like my business wasn&#39;t &#34;good enough&#34; for them, and either I order more to give them more money, or I can get the hell out. She knew exactly what she was doing. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s asked that to several customers, but other customers decided to be nice and let it go. <br><br>She asked me several times &#34;And you&#39;re SURE the lunch special is ALL you want?&#34;. Excuse me? Am I supposed to want more and order more? Do I owe you to order more? The fact that a customer even takes a look at your menu should be enough. For a customer to decide to walk up to the counter and order, they should experience nothing but RESPECT. Who the hell do you think you are, telling the customer to order more because the price they are paying isn&#39;t GOOD ENOUGH for you? And by the way, the food sucked. She was trying to see how much money she could get out of me as a customer, and made me look like a fool in front of all her coworkers and the entire restaurant. And I guess she thought she could get away with it, or else I don&#39;t think she would have behaved in such an inappropriate manner. She thinks her manager will forgive her easily if she&#39;s rude to costumers maybe? I hope her manager sees this and gives her a good talk. <br><br>This is extremely unprofessional. Do NOT keep asking customers to order more from the menu or pressure them into doing so just because you don&#39;t feel like they are giving you enough money. They don&#39;t have to give you even a DOLLAR. They could easily walk next door to the small business that sells Chinese food that has NO ISSUE with showing basic human respect to their customers. <br><br>I will NEVER return to MamaHuHu, and I will tell all my friends and family to never eat here. By the way, I grew up in San Francisco so I know half the city. None of my friends or their kids or their family or their coworkers or their grandparents or their aunts and uncles, NO ONE will eat here. <br><br>The audacity of the cashier that took my order is a representation of all the employees here. <br><br>During this time of inflation and lingering COVID-19, they should be thanking customers 10 times straight, not telling customers their business isn&#39;t welcome unless they pay more than $20, which is what I paid and is not what they deserve. <br><br>If I see my review is not here anymore in the future, I will write another bad review. Don&#39;t contact me to remove this review. <br><br>Also, the place is pretty dirty and they don&#39;t give recyclable chopsticks so you have to use chopsticks that have gone in hundreds of peoples<br>mouths. TAKE YOURSELF TO PANDA EXPRESS. I meant for this review to be 1 STAR, but Yelp will hide it if it is anything less than 3 stars. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS. The entire staff is rude.

It&#39;s this retro feel, of green 1970&#39;s shinny lamp with the nostalgic pink tile floors. The tiles remind me of all the old Chinese restaurants that I&#39;ve been to as a kid! I never appreciated the pink tiles before, but now, now that I see how it can be, and I just can&#39;t take my eyes off. I love how they can turn that dull pink around and make it fun. Just by tying it with the salmon back cushions of seats along with few pops of color. I feel like a kid at a candy store - everything is so appealing.<br><br> The rest of the place is such a visual treat: you have the literal signature namesake: 2 horse and 2 tigers on the wall against this white backdrop. You can&#39;t help but focus on them. The paintings are so hip especially with the hip hop music in the background. It&#39;s like they are saying &#34;we&#39;re hip and we know it.&#34;  Obviously, I had to find out the designer, and it&#39;s Studio BBA. <br><br>In Chinese, &#34;mamafufu&#34; also means &#34;so-so&#34; or &#34;casual&#34;. It&#39;s like something your mom will whip up in the kitchen and they&#39;re just like &#34;oh I just mamahuhu made this, hope you like it&#34;, and you know, it&#39;s like the most amazing thing ever. It&#39;s this downplay of expectations, but maybe also knowingly being satirical cuz they know they will blow your expectations out of the water.  And I should have seen this foreshadowing but I didn&#39;t, and I&#39;m blown. There are so, so many layers! The play on words is so pun, so fun, and so Chinese!<br><br>They have all these classic dishes, the spicy Mapo Tofu, the Happy Family, Kung Pao Chicken, Broccoli and Beef, and of course, Sweet and Sour Pork. And the sides like Wonton Soup, Cabbage Salad, Wok Vegetables, and Fried Rice. We got the Happy Family, Kung Pao Chicken, Mapo Tofu, and Cabbage Salad.<br><br>The Mapo Tofu is spicy. Normally, it&#39;s not that spicy like a hint of spice for flavor, but Mamahuhu has Sichuan peppercorn and they linger. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s spicy until the second and third wave come. Then I realize what I&#39;m really in for as one of my friends start sweating and taking his clothes off like the hit song from 2014. The other wisely skipped this dish.  Lucky for me, I loved it! It&#39;s so unexpected but I can&#39;t look at mapo tofus without piling on the spice.<br><br>The Happy Family is so aptly named as the ingredients blend so well. All of the ingredients are so fresh. You can appreciate the individual items within the respective whole meal, and that&#39;s true across all the dishes. The broccoli was perfection - not too crunchy or raw. <br><br>The Kung Pao chicken&#39;s tofu does taste like ham when my friend pointed it out. I can&#39;t untaste it. Again individual items stand out but also blend in. I must know how this is done!<br><br>I&#39;m not a fan of cabbage salad - especially at Chinese restaurants but here it is so different. It just comes to life! The daikon, or white radish, or what I referred to as white carrot, is ridiculously fresh and it adds so much zest.  I do not know how they can make tofu skin crunchy, what a twist!<br><br>I wanted the Chop Suey ice cream so bad but I ate so much! My stomach would not have been happy but that only means I&#39;d have to come back again! <br><br>The restaurant is probably a fun project for Chef Brandon Jew, of Mister Jiu, a Michelin Starred restaurant. It&#39;s so playful and eccentric and pleasing. It&#39;s like an adventure through things I&#39;ve been so accustomed to and then realize how much better they can be. Then I question how much better everything else can be. And I&#39;m filled with hope, and joy, and excitement. <br><br>As we were leaving,  I see someone eating alone, with the phone out watching something and nonchalantly eating the best Chinese American food I&#39;ve tasted, like it&#39;s just another take-out. Is this the American dream - to live in bliss like it&#39;s nothing because you never knew what it was before? I totally should have photojournalismed that - of how casual he is about this whole experience. He&#39;s so mamahuhu about such a well executed dinning experience, it speaks volumes to the breadth of appeal for Mamahuhu.<br><br>The only negative I&#39;ve noticed is that the seats could be a bit uncomfortable.

It&#39;s a unique addition to Clement Street -- the style of Chinese food is quite different from the more traditional options available in this area. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken bowl -- it&#39;s a base of Jasmine rice with a variety of veggies (cabbage, string beans, red peppers, celery, onion, etc.), chili, tofu, peanuts, and spicy chicken. The tofu had a smoked flavoring, which I really liked, and I generally don&#39;t like tofu. The major disappointment of the dish was the very sparse amount of chicken -- only 4 small pieces.

The restaurant, located next to Schubert&#39;s Bakery on Clement, has a cool vibe somewhere between a modern industrial chic cafe and a classic upholstered booth-y Chinese restaurant vibe. The ordering is counter service, with self serve first come first serve seating and water, with the food brought out to you for dining in. Understandably, the opening was super crowded and food took a while to come out (something exacerbated by people ordering large takeout orders), but the circumstances make that unavoidable.<br><br>The concept at Mamahuhu is meant to be classic &#34;takeout&#34; dishes reimagined and cooked with high quality, locally-sourced ingredients. The mains run around $15 each, but are also available as combo plates with rice for $15, with optional upgrades for fried rice ($3), egg roll ($2), and supreme broth ($5). Haters will complain that the food is overpriced -- though I suspect that comes primarily from an ingrained cultural bias that Chinese food is &#34;cheap food&#34;. <br><br>The food is unpretentious and delicious. The stated purpose of the restaurant is to serve up modern and inspired takes of classic Chinese dishes, and it definitely does so. <br><br>The (vegetarian) mushroom mapo tofu has a rich doubanjiang kick that&#39;s cut by the sichuan peppercorns in an excellent rendition of the dish. It is a bit more chili / acid forward, but it pairs perfectly with the rice and wok&#39;d greens. <br><br>The wok&#39;d greens that come with the combo deserve a separate mention too! They are super tender cabbage and chinese leeks topped with lightly fermented black beans that add some salty umami and are just a fantastic combination.<br><br>The egg rolls are kind of forgettable, but the supreme broth is a delicious white pepper laced, super flavorful broth that is perfect on a chilly day. <br><br>All in all, Mamahuhu is an exciting new addition to the neighborhood that delivers a bold and unapologetic interpretation of contemporary Chinese food. <br><br>Also, the shirts / pins are super cool, here&#39;s hoping that merch will be available later!",359,10,250

What  caught my attention was the gorgeous logo sign on the window, which had me stop to look at the menu sign outside.  Peeking through the window I liked what I saw--so simple yet it has this new modern feeling to it. Then when the door opened something smelled good! That&#39;s it, we now had lunch plans.<br><br>PARKING: We always park near the library which isn&#39;t far and it&#39;s free!<br><br>So you order at the counter, grab your number and sit down. I love their self serving station with all the cups, tap water, bowls, and utensils you need! You also have to bus your own dishes. I love their choice of cups and bowls by the way.<br><br>I appreciate the large sleek booth seatings, and they have smaller tables too. I love the choice of art and furniture, and the minimal decor of plants and other little decors.<br><br>SWEET &amp; SPICY CHICKEN SANDWICH - $10 <br>Crispy rice-battered chicken thigh, shredded cabbage and huhu sauce on their house made pineapple bun.<br>What had me was that it was served on a pineapple bun--how fun! I love those! The chicken Patty itself was huge, and all the sauces were amazing. I appreciated how even though there are spicy flavors, it was mild enough where I can handle the amount of heat, which I noticed in the menu they don&#39;t label it was spicy. Since it was battered and fried with rice--I&#39;m guessing rice paper? It had more of a chewier crunch.  It&#39;s not my favorite but it&#39;s not a big deal. Everything else about sandwich was (although really messy) REALLY good! Love it!!!<br><br>You can make this a combo for just  $7 (worth $11 if it&#39;s actually the same portion) more you get the following:<br><br>WEST LAKE NEEF SOUP - $6<br>Minced beef, egg white, silken tofu, chicken broth, cilantro.<br>Although I don&#39;t think this pairs with the chicken sandwich, it&#39;s a damn solid soup on its own. There&#39;s plenty of both the minced need and tofu, and it&#39;s so good. It was rainy out so it hits the spot.  Reminds me of egg drop soup but heartier.<br><br>RED TEA COLA - $5<br>Wild Tree Yunnan Red Tea, organic cane sugar, ginger, stair anise, spices. Made in house!<br>I don&#39;t drink soda but I saw how unique it sounded AND zigs made in house! If you look at their tap, the handles are terra cotta warriors! I thought that was neat. Oh yeah about the soda: it was simple, light tasting soda. I&#39;m not really one to judge since I don&#39;t drink soda but it was worth trying out! I liked the star anise garnish. However, I was kinda surprised my drink wasn&#39;t served mostly to the top.<br><br>The other thing that stood out to me on the menu was the dessert and I got:<br><br>BOBA SOFT SERVE - $7<br>Banana oat-milk sort serve, Ceylon tea syrup, tapioca pearls, sesame crunch.<br>OMG SO GOOD! There was a very generous amount of boba (tapioca petals) and they were all sweet and soft! I was afraid by sitting on soft serve it would get hard but it didn&#39;t. The soft serve itself was so good and the banana flavor was subtle and actually nice! Who knew? I actually appreciate the sesame crunch as a topping as it gave the dessert some crunch and a slight salty accent flavoring! I actually hated that sesame crunch &#34;candy&#34; as a kid. Get it, it&#39;s such a wonderful treat even ima rainy day!<br><br>What&#39;s also cool is they have a playlist going on where if you like it, there&#39;s a small flyer with a QR code you can listen on your own via Spotify!  Oh yeah I love their beading and overall look and design of your logo, menu, signs, and merch!<br><br>You know what&#39;s interesting? When I&#39;m here, I felt like I was somewhere not in Mill Valley, and I think it&#39;s a good thing.  I appreciate everything about Mamahuhu and I look forward to coming back. <br><br>Great food, great branding, great atmosphere, great music.",99,10,0

I am struggling to describe it -- a curious and unpleasant combination of spicy yet flavorless, with an odd undertone. There was even something off about the steamed rice. The cucumber dish had potential, although it proved to be insipid and more than 50% of the dish was celery, an ingredient not mentioned anywhere in the dish&#39;s description on the menu.<br><br>Plus the service was abysmal.

I just can&#39;t fathom what the idea is behind bringing a small, expensive, cliché, unremarkable menu of Chinese-American dishes to Mill Valley by a distinguished SF Chinese restaurant chef. I guess I&#39;m angriest at the fact that they took up a spot that could have been a nice new addition to town, and basically laughed in our faces. Sorry, but absurdity does not play well in restaurants as only the customer ends up being the joke. OK, nuff said--should have gone out for Thai.",99,10,90

To start, the Chrysanthemum Salad was a mixture of peppery chrysanthemum leaves, cauliflower, celery, smoked Hodo tofu, and cilantro, all topped with sesame seeds and tossed in a light vinaigrette. The classic Broccoli &amp; Beef was made with juicy slices of black-pepper grass-fed sirloin stir-fried with broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, all in a mushroom gravy. The Tomato Garlic Chow Mein was made of noodles stir-fried with a sweet and savory tomato gravy along with cherry tomatoes, peppers, onions, fried tofu, and garlic chives, all topped with sesame seeds and crispy garlic.

The food also came out a little slow, but not crazy slow and so we were offered free dessert too (which was fantastic).

I emailed about making other dishes gluten free (many Chinese restaurants will use tamari if requested) and got a nice note back. Many of their dishes use a bean paste that has a small amount of wheat in it. So, celiacs, I&#39;d advise to avoid the non-GF dishes. The intolerant may be ok! <br><br>We ordered takeout via their website, which uses ToastTab. <br><br>Egg Rolls : very small, but they&#39;re also only $5. my companion said they&#39;re great.

I believe the fish is breaded, so if you&#39;re very gluten sensitive, watch out. UPDATE : I had this cold as leftovers the next day and it was 100% delish! I will definitely get it again. Super cool mix of crispy veggies. <br><br>Westlake Soup : I&#39;ve never had this before so don&#39;t know what to compare it to. It was definitely tasty, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d order it again -- I think that&#39;s more a &#34;I might not love Westlake soup in general&#34; thing vs it being a problem with soup itself, though, because it was food, just maybe not my thing. I was kind of hoping for larger soft tofu experiences, while it was kind of ground up in the soups.  The cilantro (or whatever green herb it was)!was a nice touch. Def give it a try if you like this kind of soup. <br><br>MaPo Tofu : Holy hell. This was so spicy I started to sputter and cry. (Literal tears!) Now, I&#39;m sure some of you love this, but it was bordering on comical how painful it was for me. I&#39;m a huge fan of MaPo Tofu, and I love the typical, tingly, numbing effects of the Sichuan peppercorns. This seemed to be lighter on the Sichuan peppercorns and heavier on the chili oil and chopped up pieces of red pepper, which I register as &#34;ow ow make it stop!&#34; as opposed to &#34;oooOooOooh yeah!&#34; I think it had great flavor and I still managed to down half of the large portion -- slowly, over time, with the aid of much water and rice (while my companion looked on, chuckling.) I will try again but I really hope they can accommodate adding less of the dried red chilies I kept picking out. It&#39;s still really delicious and I recommend trying it if you can handle spice. (Side note: if you know a great MaPo tofu place and/or recipe, please message me!!! I&#39;m obsessed with this dish.)<br><br>Cucumber Salad : dedf mix it up. I just picked out a cuke or 2 without thinking to cool off my mouth from the MaPo tofu, and it was bland. (Then again that could be because I was totally numb from the tofu.) Once it&#39;s mixed up it&#39;s amazeballs. (Still not spicy, though, imo, which is also perfect by me)<br><br>Looking forward to trying other dishes, and also seeing what kind of gluten reactions I might get.

The timing was perfect bc I love breakfast items and the bf and I swung by to grab breakfast there before heading to Muir Woods bc it was on the way. I have thoroughly enjoyed the tacros when I had a chance to try them at the Ferry Building but I would sometimes just miss their hours or they would run out so it had been a very long time since I had gotten to enjoy one. Tacros are a taco shell made of croissant dough, hence the name. The breakfast tacro was filled with a folded egg, hardwood-smoked bacon, farmer&#39;s cheese, and homemade Chile de árbol hot sauce. It hit the spot. My bf had never had their tacro before so I eagerly awaited his reaction, and he thought it was pretty good. I do think of tacros I prefer the chicken and avocado one since it&#39;s more moist. And also when it comes to breakfast items, the smashed avocado toast is my favorite thing to get from here, but I&#39;m glad I gave the breakfast tacro a shot. Note: you order these at the shop only bc they&#39;re made to order for maximum crunch.<br><br>This was also our very first outdoor dining experience (which I&#39;ve only done once since). Originally we were gonna just take them back to my car but it seemed like it could get messy very quickly, so we decided to take advantage of the small tables right outside. It was convenient (and good thing bc I did make a slight mess haha), but I was slightly uncomfortable having multiple people standing nearby waiting for their orders. It felt crowded even though I think they tried to maintain their distance.<br><br>Am sad the other 2 locations are now closed.

I never posted a review because I didn&#39;t want to give just them 3 stars. <br><br>When I heard that Vive La Tarte was opening a second brick and mortar location in the former Bliss Bar in Noe Valley (I miss that place so much - friendly French owner, strong drinks, diverse crowd, AND hip hop music!), I wanted to give them another shot. <br><br>I visited their new location on day two of opening week. <br><br>Compared to their SoMa location, the pastry selection seemed limited. Makes sense since it&#39;s a much smaller space. But, the breakfast and lunch menu is pretty similar: <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2DNOYJh&amp;s=76f245d5e98ee087053452b5fef8c657ed0ef34af4be37db2d5bb66c7ed41541"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/2DNOYJh</a>. <br><br>For their Noe Valley location, looks like they added several items like the crepes and a kid&#39;s menu. For drinks, they have tea, coffee (Sightglass), kombucha, wine, and mimosas. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for their novelty Tacro (taco-croissant), it&#39;s only available at their Ferry Building kiosk. <br><br>This time, I wanted to try their Cheesecake or Hazelnut Brittle Tart but they were sold out/not available. They did have their Breakfast Pizza so I decided to go with that (on my 3 visits at the SoMa location, it was sold out). <br><br>* Breakfast Pizza w/ egg, hill&#39;s bacon, green onions, crème fraîche ($8): <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2GhPUrg&amp;s=af279923a970ce2d60db0636a752a75630271099ca853d8eb3630b2d2cfd3b58"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/2GhPUrg</a>.<br><br>Unfortunately, it was sorely disappointing. It seems like it was left in the oven too long as the pizza was very dry and crouton-like. No runny yolk either so I just picked at the toppings. <br><br>On the upside, I found the employees to be much nicer AND more approachable than their SoMa location. That&#39;s important for any neighborhood spot. <br><br>I visited on a weekday afternoon and all the two tops were taken; mainly by laptop campers so I found a seat in the communal table.

And I really mean it, too. I was passing by this place a few days ago and realized that I had never noticed it before. I have walked down 24th thousands of times and for some reason I have never thought to look into Vive La Tarte. I set an intention to go in today and am so glad I did. It is the cutest little space with actual baking equipment meaning they obviously make their goods in house. The smell of heaven (aka fresh baked bread) permeated the air when I walked in. First good sign. Then, I was greeted very politely by who I presume to be the owner of the place. I placed my order and within minutes got my avo toast. I couldn&#39;t wait to get home to try it. Now, I&#39;ve been repeatedly disappointed by avo toast that I pay $15 for so I was apprehensive about this one too. However, as soon as I opened the box and saw the little poached egg on top and once I stuck my fork in it and the yolk oozed out, I knew this was a good one! And my first bite confirmed it, too. The mashed avo is very flavorful and the tomatoes and pickled tomatillo complement it well. And the bread--the lovely sourdough bread--that serves as a vehicle for this avo mash was truly the star of it all. It was soft and pillowy (clearly fresh baked that morning) and had the most beautiful taste of well cultured sourdough. The portions were generous as well. Overall, A plus for their avo toast and I&#39;m excited to try their other baked goods!",129,10,50

I don&#39;t know if it is the bread or the combo of toppings but this may have been one of the best avocado toasts I have ever had. It is definitely expensive but honestly so satisfying that I would not hesitate to get this again.

I do wish they would do re-fills for orders staying in the store but I also didn&#39;t ask.<br><br>Overall, everything was great and the above came out to ~$20 which isn&#39;t cheap but also isn&#39;t outrageous.

Anyways we got the pulled pork scramble and PB&#39;s favorite. PB&#39;s favorite came with your choice of pancakes or French toast, eggs and a protein. I got their famous banana mascarpone pancake and the pork patty with eggs over medium. The pancake is definitely the star. I didn&#39;t find it overly sweet - like it expected. The mascarpone was very subtle in flavor. Lots of candied walnuts. The banana was yummy- I just wish there was more - it felt like a third of a small banana. And it was drizzled with a sweet cream, almost frosting like. You can add some of the whipped cream and maple syrup for more sweetness- but you can control how much to add. The pork patty was alright - it was very crumbly and soft. It was a bit cold - which makes me wonder if it was cooked from frozen. The pulled pork scramble was yummy too. It came with home fries. They came out hot and crispy, probably fried to order. I had a bite of the egg with pulled pork. I had a bunch of onions and the whole thing was slathered with a green salsa. Also both dishes came with an orange slice - a nice ending to the meal. I would recommend both entrees.",1228,10,10

There&#39;s so many great reviews on Yelp which is what helped us decide where we were going to go. The place was packed. There&#39;s seating inside as well as tables outside.

She was waiting on several tables at the same time and seating many people at the same time. I kid you not, this lady takes multitasking to another level. We need more people at restaurants that move like her.<br><br>Anyway, what bothered me about this day was what happened next. The gal at the other table was vegetarian or vegan because when she ordered she asked a lot of questions. I&#39;m not the type to stare at people eating, it&#39;s just that we were in this small intimate private area that it was hard not to see each other. As she was finishing up her meal she sees a hair strand in her food. The gal quickly gets up and does NOT make a scene. She takes her plate inside the restaurant and talks to the server privately and quietly and that lady went off on her. She made a huge deal saying she just wants a free meal blah blah blah and I really don&#39;t think that was nice. This lady quietly went inside and didn&#39;t even say anything, she just told them that she wants that part taken out of her bill because it&#39;s inedible and instead of just taking it off and moving along, they ridiculed this lady. I felt so bad and it was awkward since we were in the same small private seating area.<br><br>I gave this place a 3 star because they could work on their communication a little bit. I think it wasn&#39;t nice how it was handled and if that poor girl ever reads this... just know that you were not in the wrong.

There&#39;s a little surprise inside, which I&#39;m not sure what it is but I think that&#39;s the souffle part. Lastly, the sandwich was definitely a burger. It had a fried egg and sausage patty, a little teeny bit spicy. Of the 3, this was my least favorite, only because I&#39;m not a huge fan of sausage. But the overall taste was fine. I enjoyed the hash browns as well. That crispy crunchy yum. <br><br>The Raspberry Mimosa did not have any hint of alcohol taste to it, which is great but it was $10 for that small champagne glass!!

Feel like I&#39;m just eating a big pieces of bread. I never order pancakes ever.<br><br>But then I came to you. Because those yelp pictures were amazing. And my parents were in town and it&#39;s hard to impress them with food so wanted to find something they&#39;ve never had before. Plus the neighborhood around there is quaint, very SF (you all know what I mean)... so that gives us a place to stroll around (especially with your ridiculously long wait).<br><br>So one beautiful saturday we came. <br>Neighborhood was lively. Small shops were quaint. Really nice area. Come ready to walk!<br><br>Ask the lady about the wait. &#34;about an hour&#34; she says.<br>Fine. So be it. I came in expecting 45m to an hour anyway. Plus that&#39;s what the nice neighborhood is for.<br><br>So we went an enjoyed the neighborhood. came back in about 45 minutes (because no way I am missing them calling our name and losing our spot). The lady circles our name and says she is still waiting for tables to open up.<br><br>So we wait. and wait. and wait. another 30 minutes or so go by before we are seated. If you do the math that is 1hours and 15 minutes so far. It&#39;s ok. I am patient. The food will either redeem the wait or make it upsetting.

(it was to help melt the half-frozen baby food we brought)<br><br>So here is the only minus of the night. You guys seemed a little understaffed. The 2 serving ladies in there were way too busy. 1 more would have been nice. Took our order after about 10 minutes. After another 10 minutes we flagged the other lady down to ask for the hot water again. After another few minutes asked again. Basically they were too busy and couldn&#39;t get around to it or they forgot.<br><br>After some time - our food came.<br>So yea. Those pancakes are a sight to see. I made that nice cut so I can show off the insides to my folks. They were very impressed. Couldn&#39;t stop talking about how amazing they were and trying to figure out how to duplicate it at home.<br><br>I was impressed to. Very good. best pancakes ever. would order them every time. The other dishes were pretty on point as well. no complaints here. The only other thing that was just as praise worthy were those hashbrowns. Yes. I hate hashbrowns that have a thin fried layer with half cooked hash inside. Oh I hate that. it&#39;s hashBROWNs not hashWHITES. not hash-uncooked! but these were crisp thru and thru. Thinly laid out. I know how hard it is to make good hashbrowns. When I do it at home it&#39;s so uneven. So props to the hash.<br><br>Now going back to the one downside. We asked for some small plates since we were sharing. It never came. At this point I gave up and didn&#39;t bother asking again. Not that anyone ever came to check on us. Again 1 more staff whose job is not to bring dishes but to just serve the tables would be perfect! Considering this I was a little peeved that an 18% gratuity was tacked onto the bill. We had 4 adults and one infant. So the restaurant counted that as 5. So apparently here it&#39;s not 6 ppl but 5. I don&#39;t mind 18% at all... it&#39;s just rubbing salt on the wound when the service was near non-existent and then it&#39;s tacked on.. while counting the baby. Just one of those killed by a million cuts.. or whatever the phrasing is.<br><br>Anyway, the pancakes were so good. I was this close to 5 starring it anyway.

If you come on a weekday morning though, you can stroll right in for immediate seating.<br><br>MY RECOMMENDATIONS: <br>1) Lemon Ricotta Souffle Pancakes w/ Strawberry Coulis - Light and fluffy with a meringue-like center. Just be aware that the airy center tastes more like egg white than whipped cream as it appears!<br>2) Salmon Tartine - Smoked salmon, avocado, and scrambled eggs on a fluffy toasted bun, topped with dill hollandaise and pickled red onions. The tartine comes with seasoned crispy wedge potato fries that have a delightful coating similar to curly fries. You can sub them for hash browns if you&#39;d like. <br>3) 6-hour Corned Beef Hash: chunks of flavorful, tender corned beef and potatoes, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The wedge fries seemed like carb overload, but they&#39;re so delicious you can kiss your diet goodbye! <br><br>Griddle fresh is a solid brunch spot! 4.5 stars rounded to 5 for some of their standout menu items, including the hashed browns, souffle pancakes, and salmon tartine.

We were seated within 5 minutes, so get here before 11am if you don&#39;t want a wait.

If you&#39;re looking for a typical french toast, this is not it. Aside from that dish, the other two stole the show. The smoked salmon tartine was a good balance of flavors between the saltiness of the salmon, the sourness of the pickled onions, softness of the thin omelette, and creaminess of the avocado. As if the tartine wasn&#39;t enough, the hashbrowns here are out of this world! Definitely one of the best hashbrowns I have ever had --that&#39;s saying a lot! The thin layer of golden brown crispiness was almost like munching on chips. It&#39;s already so flavored that you really don&#39;t need anything else; forget the ketchup (I mean, unless you really love it that much). To finish off, the lemon ricotta pancake was nothing short of expectations either. It comes in three thick and fluffy stacks of pancakes filled with ricotta, which I almost mistaken as egg whites since it was such a smooth texture. It wasn&#39;t overbearing of sweetness, which is always a fear when I pick a sweet item on the menu.<br><br>Griddle Fresh is the spot to go for brunch in SF.

The green sauce on top was really good too. I liked the hash; it&#39;s a tad thin, but that&#39;s probably how it gets so crispy and savory. Super good! It&#39;s a nice touch that you get crunchy as well as soft textures happening in one plate. <br><br>Definitely one of the better places that I&#39;ve been to in SF! Would highly recommend.

Maybe HE should be Yelping! A little disappointed in myself for missing that, but not disappointed in the dish.<br><br>Salmon Tartine - very light and tasty. Smoked salmon was on point, and (again) as my brother said, that dill makes the dish. Gives it the pop it needs. Eggs are fluffy and the bread added some substance and crunch.<br><br>Pet peeve: Dishes coming out one at a time, piece-meal, so only one person gets a dish and then next one does after some minutes...

These three sweet, fluffy pancakes were a good counterpoint to the savory corned beef hash. I&#39;m not a huge fan of meringue - but I was intrigued by these pancakes. I don&#39;t know how they make them exactly. Like a soufflé, they may have taken whipped egg whites/meringue and folded in the pancake batter. When you&#39;re biting through the pancake, it feels like a thick layer of meringue is sandwiched in between a thin crust or layer of pancake batter. The meringue doesn&#39;t have a ton of flavor, but the outer layer definitely tastes like pancakes. I don&#39;t know...it &#39;s weird. Just try it.<br><br>I seriously wish I could have eaten more food, but splitting both of these dishes plus a fresh squeezed orange juice that tasted fresh squeezed was more than filling. <br><br>*The wait on a Saturday for 2 people around 10 am was about 20 minutes.

I typically do have cake for breakfast, so the level of sweetness was perfect for me, but I can see this dish being a little much for normal folk who aren&#39;t addicted to sugar. For such people, I recommend the luxurious and eggy French toast, with its perfect balance of crispy borders and a soft, delicious center. I think it may come with maple syrup or butter, but the bread is so good and the flavor so robust, I don&#39;t think you even need these standard accoutrements.<br><br>Another thing worth mentioning is the hashbrowns.

Sorry to disappoint you pervs on this Monday morning.<br><br>Brunch on me in exchange to get Mr. NSS&#39; arse out of bed to enjoy the rare summer weather in SF is what I&#39;m talking about. <br><br>Just 4 months young, it seems Griddle Fresh seems to be a favorite brunch among in Noe Valleyians. Soufflé pancakes, house made sausage, house made pull pork, and fried egg sandwich...how can you not resist a place with such enticing items on the menu? I surely can&#39;t. The menu actually reminded me a bit of Plow but in a more down home kind of way. Street parking can be a bit tough during peak hours but we got lucky and found parking a block away. All the surrounding meters are smart meters so no need to fumble with coins because you can use your credit card to pay. <br><br>Wanting to beat the brunch rush, we arrived at Griddle Fresh after 1:30 pm on Saturday to find there was only a 5 min wait. WHOO HOOO! As a side note, griddle Fresh closes at 2:45 pm not 3 pm as listed on Yelp. It&#39;s small with just 10-12 tables so expect a wait during peak hours. Not good for large groups. <br><br>To be safe we stuck with their House Favorites: The 6-Hour Corned Beef Hash ($12 + $1 avocado) and The Smoked Salmon Tartine ($13). Both come with their crispy wedges. I substituted for their hash browns which I was lusting over after seeing some pics over Yelp. <br><br>The Corned Beef Hash was by far the best one I&#39;ve tried: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1cnHGsx&amp;s=c3c9af9b678c34df3e11a4e72acfd3e44f5155084d96194e98e55da789d97e55"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1cnHGsx</a> (top view). Fork into the poached eggs and let the yolk lava over the brisket for the ultimate foodgasmic bite. Each piece was uber tender and robust in flavor. The wasabi crema gave a nice touch of spicy tang. I think our biggest gripe is was there wasn&#39;t enough (too much potatoes): <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1bQzQVz&amp;s=f36ca90ffc4251d38ca984da4b5e2543bfec7212b4329ce59709d8804694a721"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1bQzQVz</a> (close-up). Unless it&#39;s skinny fries, I don&#39;t care for fries much but the crispy wedges were ridiculously good. It reminded me of Plow&#39;s potatoes but in a wedge form sans the caramelized onions and herbs; layers of crunchiness and not greasy. SO GOOD. <br><br>After sampling Mr. NSS dish, it was time to dig into my Smoked Salmon Tartine: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F19vspyT&amp;s=0fb1eb7e504718aa875e1c505888c6d3b8a05ab75aeb766ffe9ab134f6b50070"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/19vspyT</a> (top view). A griddled brioche bun is halved and topped with a layer of buttery avocados, a huge fluffy chive omelet w/ creamy Neufchâtel cheese, slices of smoked salmon and lemon dill aioli: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1fd35Gb&amp;s=1badddf619f148cbc4b9db44c43b7a453cf4f2bee29531df0ecd6f4979af0260"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1fd35Gb</a> (close-up). The combo of the different layers was sublime; it was decadent without being over the top heavy. The accompanying paper thin hashbrowns were perfectly browned and oh so crisp. <br><br>Service was very warm, friendly, and prompt. Seems to be family owned which gives me more reason to support businesses like this. As we were leaving, each one of the staff thanked us for coming with a smile. Such a simple gesture to do yet a majority of businesses fail to do. <br><br>4 solid stars for the food but boosting it to 5 stars for the great service and since the business is still in its infancy stages. <br><br>Even though I was successful in getting him out for brunch, his arse fell back asleep when we got home.

I didn&#39;t taste any hint of lemon, but rather an overly-sweetened strawberry coulis drizzled on top of the 3-stack pancakes. The souffle-like filling was reminiscent of whipped meringue. Overall, it&#39;s an interesting dish, one that I&#39;ve never tried before, but I wouldn&#39;t reorder it again.<br><br>On the other hand, Griddle Fresh&#39;s salmon tartine was delicious. The smoked salmon was salty but balanced well with the creamy, tangy, and lemony dill aioli. The eggs were nice and fluffy, and the pickled red onions added a good amount of umami taste. The most disappointing aspect of this dish was the soggy brioche bun. The accompanying side of home wedge fries was decent, but I preferred the smaller pieces as they were much crispier and not as gritty in the center. Definitely have these with the slightly sweet house ketchup!<br><br>The Seaboard Benedict was also tasty, with a generous amount of fresh shrimp and crab. However, the poached eggs were a little overcooked and not runny. The side of thin hashbrowns had a crispy texture, but it was very oily and tasted burnt.<br><br>Griddle Fresh is a very small restaurant, so prepare for an hour-long wait during weekend peak hours.

One of the perils of eating at one of the two outside tables, I think, instead of condiments and spices there&#39;s a tiny little side of neglect and you will def need to ask any and every time you want your coffee refilled. <br><br>The place is tiny so expect a wait and don&#39;t be a dummy and show up with more than 4 people unless you want to gum up the system and be waiting for 2 hours.

The ricotta??

When it finally came, it was wrong. What rapidly became clear was that when they&#39;re very busy, they&#39;re out of their depth. I don&#39;t know if it was the server in question or the busy-ness they were experiencing on a Saturday morning (which phenomenon you&#39;d think they&#39;d be familiar with), but though the food was still terrific, the service significantly suffered. If it had been our first visit rather than our second, we wouldn&#39;t have returned. <br><br>Recommendation: Try to go very much earlier than you&#39;re planning so as to miss the rush. Or try to go on a morning that might not typically suggest breakfast out. They&#39;re much more on their game when things are slower.",1228,10,640

Griddle Fresh is hands down the best breakfast I had ever had the pleasure of enjoying. I just had to share my excitement!  Six hours after brunch, I still couldn&#39;t get over how much I like Griddle Fresh. This review is probably going to be a bit on the bias side, considering how ecstatic I was about my experience at the cafe. <br> <br>First, I can see why the place gets really crowded! It&#39;s a tiny cafe with about 10 tables, which are approximately two feet away from each other. I&#39;m glad I only waited 15 minutes until I was seated. <br><br>The service was pleasing. Our waitress gave us a fair amount of time before returning to ask for our orders. The turnaround time was great! Not to mention, we all received our meals within two minutes of one another. I hate that awkward moment when the party has to wait to eat because someone&#39;s food didn&#39;t make it to the table with the rest (crisis avoided!). It did take a while for us to get a box, but that&#39;s an innocuous offense. They&#39;re busy! We understand. <br><br>$14 - Parma Flavor. Amazing. That&#39;s all I can say. It&#39;s a dish you really must try. It&#39;s easy to consume; not messy like some of the other plates. The perfectly cooked eggs and the prosciutto (Italian dry-cured ham) was the best combination. The Parma Flavor was topped with fresh mozzarella, Roma tomatoes, and basil. So heavenly. The hash was cooked evenly and just as delicious! <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely be going back!",1228,10,690

So I said let me check it out, and maybe I&#39;ll be back for more.. but.. this is what happened.. <br>The waitress was a little bit overwhelmed she was the only one working and sure did show it we ordered and then my aunt asked for more water she kinda slammed it on the table.

We tried 4 different items, buttermilk pancakes, BLT sandwich, Tex-Mex omelette and the salmon cake Benedict. All but one was good. Can you guess? The salmon cake Benedict! It was so dry, mostly breading, we also had to ask for extra hollandaise sauce, my aunt said $18 for that?! I&#39;ll never get that again!  <br>We asked the hostess to please give 2 boxes and the check, she came back to apologize for the wait which I was thankful she acknowledged it.

It&#39;s popular, and for good reason. If you&#39;re like me and hate to wait for anything, suck it up and endure the wait for this place. It was so damn good, and I&#39;m glad we waited! It&#39;s an extremely small restaurant, which explains the long wait times, but the service is quick and fast--so you really won&#39;t have to spend much time waiting for your food. Bonus points!<br><br>We ordered the salmon tartine and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Because, let&#39;s be real, these are really the reasons why anyone comes here. I ordered my salmon tartine with the classic potato wedges while the boyfriend opted for their most famous hash. Tbh, I prefer the wedges over the hash (but it&#39;s because I prefer wedges/cut potatoes over hash). They almost tasted like french fries!<br><br>The tartine is kind of like their twist on an eggs benedict. Which I think is way better than a benedict because I&#39;m not really a fan of English muffins. Theirs is on a brioche bun, which is amazing and soft and delicious and I&#39;m salivating just thinking about it now. Also--portions are very generous. I got a lot of salmon on mine!<br><br>The lemon ricotta pancakes were good, but they weren&#39;t as good as I expected. I love pancakes and I love souffles, but something about these weren&#39;t quite right. I think we had way too much ricotta in our pancakes that I couldn&#39;t even really taste the pancake anymore. It was straight up lemon ricotta--where&#39;s the pancakes?! But don&#39;t get me wrong--they were still pretty good. I probably wouldn&#39;t reorder them next time though.<br><br>One last thing: I strongly advise against bringing a large group. They don&#39;t do reservations, the restaurant is very small, and it&#39;s just not doable.

Umm I don&#39;t think that is the correct way to serve food to your customers. Also we decided to order the lemon ricotta soufflé pancakes and boy were they nasty... You wold think there should be a good amount of ricotta inside, but instead they try and fill up that space with egg. It&#39;s very easy to tell the difference between ricotta and egg so there is no point in naming them ricotta pancakes if there is barely any ricotta included. <br><br>Overall I have to say this was not a very good experience. The servers were never to be found and the food didn&#39;t taste great.",1228,10,730

We were given prompt and friendly service right away and our servers (we had two) answered the many questions I had and were pretty knowledgable about the menu.

I was worried it wouldn&#39;t be enough food because my sister and I are huge eaters, but the portions were VERY generous: especially the corn beef hash. The corn beef hash was PERFECTLY cooked; big chunks of juicy, delicious corned beef brisket, so tender. It was topped with two perfectly poached eggs along with crispy potato wedges seasoned to perfection. And if all that wasn&#39;t enough, it ALSO included a side of toast. Now on to the pancakes. They were SO fluffy they jiggle! And they were BOMB, just as everyone said they&#39;d be: not too sweet- just right. Now I see why they&#39;re so famous. The two dishes made a beautiful combo! After we got the check, I asked if we could split the check 4 ways- the most annoying of requests. Our servers, however, had no problem doing this at all! Overall, the only problem I did have was that their plain black coffee was $3.50- which I thought was a little outrageous, but everything else was decently priced.

The problem was... everything else. The omelette was accompanied by hash browns, smashed into a wafer-thin pancake that occupied half the plate, cooked to the consistency of a potato chip. And like a potato chip, it was virtually impossible to eat with a knife and fork. Seriously, guys, if you want to serve potato chips instead of hash browns, just give me an honest bag of potato chips and spare me the hassle.<br><br>My wheat toast turned out to be one pathetic little slice of toast, unbuttered and lukewarm when it arrived, accompanied by an ice-cold, pat of rock-hard butter, making it impossible to butter the toast properly.

After experiencing 1-2 hour waits at places like Brenda&#39;s and Sweet Maple, and considering brunch is now San Francisco&#39;s &#34;it&#34; thing, 20 minutes was nothing. And after 20 minutes, we were seated and enjoying Griddle Fresh&#39;s cozy and quaint interior, <br><br>We ordered the banana walnut marscapone souffle pancakes and the smoked salmon tartine to share. Both were AMAZING. The pancakes were literally the best pancakes I have ever had. They were super light and fluffy and not super sweet, which I really liked because I&#39;m more of a savory girl. And the candied walnuts were great. The smoked salmon tartine is probably my new favorite breakfast item. It&#39;s basically a thin piece of bread--good bread, not like some crap Wonderbread--with avocado, eggs, smoked salmon, dill sauce, and onions and sprouts layered on it. The thing is, the eggs are the BEST EGGS EVER (and I&#39;m kind of an egg fanatic). It&#39;s basically an omelette with chives mixed into it but they make the eggs super soft and fluffy. Absolutely divine. And the potato wedges that come with the tartine are perfectly crisp and salty. We also got mimosas, which were just the cherry on top to a great brunch.  <br><br>The thing that&#39;s great about Noe Valley is that is has all these great eateries and semi-upscale boutiques, but it doesn&#39;t read overtly hipster like the mission or pretentious like the marina. I got the same vibe from Griddle Fresh. The decor (or lack thereof) was super simple and the staff was really friendly. Dishes are reasonably priced at $10-$15 an entree. Mimosas are $8 and my only problem with them is that there is no option to go bottemless. Parking around here isn&#39;t too terrible.

Maybe it is a partial result of my high expectations, so I suppose take it with a grain of salt, but regardless, I was not impressed. <br><br>First, the services was confusingly brusk.  It was like one question we asked regarding the menu was an inconvenience keeping him from other, more important business. We ordered the famous lemon ricotta soufflé pancakes, but asked for the strawberry sauce on the side.  When it came out, the sauce was still all over the pancakes, but the strawberries themselves had clearly been scraped into a dish on the side after having been put on top.  When I said we ordered it on the side, the lady just pointed to the strawberries on the side of the plate, ignoring the bright pink sauce smothering the rest of the pancakes, and moved on with her life. <br><br>On top of that, the food was underwhelming.  Not bad. But not great.  We had the lemon ricotta soufflé pancakes, the salmon cake Benedict, and the griddle fresh burger -- a nice sampling of food we thought.  The salmon cakes tasted a little fishy and dry, but the accompanying hash browns were good. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but definitely not something I would ever order again.  The burger was also okay, but significantly overcooked.  It was hard to taste any of the most important flavors through the overcooked meat. <br><br>Finally, the pancakes.  I was SO excited for these babies, as I love me some quality lemon ricotta pancakes. These were definitely the best of the three things we ordered, but not what I was hoping for. I can&#39;t tell if there was just too much ricotta, or if the ricotta wasn&#39;t mixed together well enough, but something wasn&#39;t quite right.  It&#39;s like the potential was totally there, and they just weren&#39;t living up to it. They were beautifully light at first, but the middle was very full of a denser ricotta that detracted from it&#39;s lightness. Also, it lost some of it&#39;s flavor there. (If you liked lemon ricotta pancakes, try Venus Restaurant in Berkeley! so good). <br><br>Anyway, it wasn&#39;t bad, per se, but wasn&#39;t great by my standards. I felt like we gave it a real shot, and ordered a variety of items, none of which were great.  Definitely not worth the slightly higher prices or the longer wait.  Other people seems to love it, so maybe it was an off day when we went, but I&#39;ll likely skip this place in the future, and wouldn&#39;t recommend it, with all the other amazing options in the surrounding areas.",1228,10,960

They kind of have the consistency of uncooked meringue and they more or less fell apart into a foamy, gooey, mess. I expected them to either be fluffy or crepe-like, but they were neither of those things. The taste was great, but the texture was a little off-putting for me.

Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered and all of us agreed that their unique brunch fare would be worth coming back for to try some more of their great looking dishes. Some of the items we tried were the corned beef with poached eggs, the fried egg sandwich and the chorizo scramble with jalapeno relish and all were great. Even some of the little things were done well, like the high quality bread the offer for their toast and the generous portion of fresh avocado they use as garnish on some of their egg dishes. The only complaint that comes to mind for me was that my corned beef dish came over red potatoes and also a side of their house potatoes which come with most of their brunch dishes - if the dish already has potatoes in it they should serve it with a different side because no one needs two helpings of potatoes with their breakfast. Also the place is a little crowded and cramped but the quality of their food makes it more than worth it (just go early or you&#39;ll be waiting outside for awhile). I will definitely be going back again soon.",1228,10,1220

In fact I often get it on the side because it tends to be too bland or unbalanced, too rich or lacking acid. Novy&#39;s hollandaise is the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. I could taste just a hint of Tabasco and the richness of quality butter but the citrus was noticeably forward yet not overly acidic and perfectly balanced.  Suddenly, the clouds parted, angels sang, and I became a fan of hollandaise. My server was amazing and asked the chef what his recipe is and it turns out he adds lemon AND lime juice to the hollandaise, not just lemon! I think the lime adds more citrus but it&#39;s more rounded and less sharp than if you just doubled the lemon. Absolutely changed my entire opinion on hollandaise and raised the bar significantly.  <br><br>If you go for brunch and love a good benedict, please don&#39;t skip the hollandaise and give it a try.  The rest of the menu is ok too.",538,10,20

This is a modern take on Greek cuisine. There&#39;s a definite respect for the past and a definite eye to innovation as well. The result is usually delightful, and even when it doesn&#39;t rise to that level, it is still very good and satisfying.<br><br>Without further ado, here are the dishes I&#39;ve had the pleasure to enjoy at Novy:<br><br>Horiatiki salad (5/5): This is my weekday go-to when I want a light meal. A nice mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, and feta in an intense, but not too intense, vinaigrette. Dependable and utterly satisfying as a lunch. I&#39;ve had this several times and it is consistently outstanding.<br><br>Feta polenta (5/5): this is a polenta topped with feta cheese, mushrooms, and walnuts, with a balsamic vinegar sauce. Again this is an absolute delight to eat with the sauce giving a real tang to every bite. I would definitely have this again.<br><br>Hummus (4.5/5): This is good, solid hummus, not exciting, but at the same time uplifted by the sundried tomato relish that comes with it. The relish makes a nice contrast with the hummus. Both go well with the pita that comes along with it. I might get this now and then.<br><br>Lamb Bolognese (4 with chili flakes to 4.5 with pepper shaker/5): I&#39;ve had this one twice, once with just the pepper on the table and once with chili flakes that were thoughtfully offered. I prefer it with just the pepper, but it was good to try it with the chili. Now I know. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the lamb sauce is hearty. I would definitely keep this dish on my rotation.<br><br>Moussaka (5/5): While I am not an expert on Greek cuisine, I would guess that this is the closest dish to pure traditional Greek food at this restaurant, at least among the dishes that I have had. Every bite is a bite of absolute deliciousness. Comes with a side salad which alas, is not up to the excitement of the horiatiki, but is still serviceable. I am here for the moussaka, not for the salad, so that&#39;s a minor quibble. I will totally come back to this dish.<br><br>Galaktoboureko (5/5): I struggle to remember the name of this dish. Fortunately it is easily recognized on the menu. I have never encountered this dish anywhere else. I would not have been surprised to learn that they invented this, but no, it is apparently quite traditional. Since I&#39;ve never seen it anywhere else, I don&#39;t know how much they are following tradition and how much they are riffing on it. Whatever they&#39;re doing, they&#39;re doing it right and I absolutely love this dessert and will return to it in the future. I&#39;m a sucker for places that serve dishes that are not the usual suspects, and this fits the bill royally. Foodies, take notice.<br><br>Baklava (5/5): This is not your corner store baklava. I am guessing that they make it in-house, it is so different from the baklava that I usually see. Same ingredients but sprawling and moist. This is taking baklava to a whole &#39;nother level. I would return to this again and again. It may have even spoiled me for baklava, and the corner store variety may never do it for me again. Once more, foodies, take notice.<br><br>Brioche Bread Pudding (4/5): There is nothing wrong with this dish. There&#39;s also nothing unusual about this dish. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s here as a good safe desert choice along with the flourless chocolate cake, which I haven&#39;t tried but likely is also perfectly good. <br><br>Given the joy I got from the galaktoboureko and the baklava, I may never get to the flourless chocolate cake. At the very least, it will take me a while.<br><br>I did try the horta (chard) side and it was not to my taste. I&#39;m also not a fries fan, so I may never try the gyros.<br><br>Service at both lunch and dinner are quite pleasant and efficient.<br><br>Props to them for making it clear on the menu that there is a 5% San Francisco surcharge. They put a card on the tables showing the night&#39;s specials (cioppino on Friday and Saturday nights, which I look forward to trying) with the price so I don&#39;t have to ask. They also clearly mark which dishes are subject to a potential health risk from undercooking rather than just putting it as a generic footnote and leaving me to guess what is safe and what is not. Great transparency, which is very pro-customer.<br><br>Plenty of covered, heated outdoor seating.",538,10,30

We were in the neighborhood and thinking about the good ol&#39;days at Pasta Pomodero (former restaurant here). So we decided to stop into NOVY and check out, we love Greek and Mediterranean food - so we try it. I didn&#39;t even check the reviews first, but what a total score. <br><br>We ordered a bottle of wine to start and the sauvignon we picked went with everything we ordered well. We ordered all small plates for dinner, thinking that this would be too much - we loved it all. <br><br>Dolmas: I love dolmas, but have not had them quite like this. Not only was the flavor on point, they were warm and the sauce balanced the flavor of the dolma. So savory and still think about this dish, a lot. No cold deli or salad buffet dolmas for me anymore. <br><br>Greek Fries: Great fries, crispy and topped with lemon, oregano, garlic, mizithra cheese. Great appetizer to share. <br><br>Grilled Octopus: We had to order the Grilled octopus, which was grilled - yet still tender inside. We should have ordered two of these, but there&#39;s next time. The Grilled Octopus is combined with castelvetrano olives, potatoes and frisee salad. All love for this dish. <br><br>Grilled Halloumi: If you love cheese and have never tried grilled halloumi, you need to get on this. The Halloumi is a beautiful slab of semi hard cheese that melts slow, so it&#39;s grilled to perfection without melting and topped with herbs and spices. Ok, then add the artichoke and date tapenade, grilled pita and this dish is not to be missed. <br><br>This was a great place for a dinner of appetizers, but also a great experience to try a few of their dishes. Usually I yelp my spots before I try them, but this was a total walk in score. Also, service was friendly and although busy, food came out quickly as they were made and we were very happy.",538,10,70

Greek was decided, and my one and only request is that we have baklava for dessert. Spoiler alert; NOVY&#39;s baklava is bomb. <br><br>Before I dive into the ambiance and the food, I have to commend the lovely waitress that serviced our table; sadly I do not remember her name. We arrived at the restaurant for a 5:30PM reservation for the prior night (11/18/2019), and the waitress had ginger hair and wore a red cardigan with light blue denim jeans. There was a table seated to the left of our table and they were being very disruptive and rather rude. Elderly couple just could not keep their mouths shut when it came to their meal; they had a complaint for everything from the lighting being too dim, the servers taking away their finished dishes (yes, their food were finished yet refused to allow the servers to take away or clean), and the elderly male even went as far as to saying some rather inappropriate (racist anti-female jokes). The waitress did such a good job in being diligent and patient by continuing to service them. Both my table and the table next to the elderly couple commented that they were being very inappropriate. All I have to say is that if you have nothing nice to say, do not say anything at all.<br><br>NOVY is very trendy but also has a rustic charm with it&#39;s dark wood furniture. It is very easy to find located in the Noe Valley area of San Francisco and close to the hip Castro district. <br><br>Now for the food:<br>For the appetizers, we decided on Garlic Fries, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, and Spanakopita. My friend and I thought we may have over ordered as we usually do when we dine with each other; a blessing and a curse at the same time where at one end we get to try more and at the other we may not finish everything. This was perfect. We both agree that the garlic fries were perfectly crisp and seasoned well. I enjoyed the spinach and cheese filled spanakopita (puff pastry) and was really light to eat. The brussel sprouts were delicious but maybe a bit too roasted for me.<br><br>For The Mains:<br>I opted for the Lamb Bolognese which I loved. Tender pasta, tomato sauce with minced lamb, and feta cheese made this dish simple yet so tasty. The portion is big enough for two to share, and so I decided to take home the remainder as a snack.<br><br>My friend ordered the Seasonal Horiatiki salad with Steak. It looked like a classic Greek salad that we both would love. <br><br>Now For Something Sweet:<br>Since there was two of us, we each ordered a dessert and shared it. As mentioned, I had to have baklava and so I ordered one with vanilla ice cream while my friend ordered a cream filled puff pastry with slivered almonds and berry colis. Both desserts were equally delicious and not heavy. The baklava was definitely my favorite of the two; I liked the mixture of (pecans and almonds?) blended with a lightly sweet honey. The puff pastry was different; I would say it felt like a deconstructed berry pie with a cheese filling. <br><br>The food, ambiance, and service was amazing and I would definitely come back.",538,10,100

We ordered:<br><br>Lamb Bolognese (2/5): Why did I order this? I regret it so much. I literally only ate 2 bites of this, and gave it to my friend. The menu described this dish as a creative Mediterranean play on Bolognese, cooked with Mediterranean spices and such.

I was sorely disappointed.<br><br>Salmon Pasta Special (3.5/5): This was a seasonal special that they had on the menu. It was probably the best dish out of all four that we ordered. The salmon itself was pretty good -  a little overcooked if I can be extra picky about it. The cream penne was standard - nothing out of the ordinary. I thought it was weird adding asparagus to the dish, because the flavor profile of that vegetable didn&#39;t feel like it complemented the rest of the dish.<br><br>Spicy Shrimp (3/5): This wasn&#39;t bad! The bacon gave the dish an extra oomph, and the shrimp were actually beautifully cooked. The flavors were most prominent in this dish, since the rest of the dishes had a blander taste profile. <br><br>Panos Burger (3/5): This was basically a burger made with a Greek flair. It didn&#39;t QUITE meet the mark, but it wasn&#39;t half bad! I thought the bun was a little too dry. If it was toasted to perfection, this dish could have easily been at 4 stars.

I took the J-line one evening after work and decided to take a stroll to find something to eat. I remembered when this was a very popular Pasta Pomodoro, and frankly it doesn&#39;t look that different except now they serve Greek food. But hey, wasn&#39;t it a Greek place called Panos before? Why, yes it was, and the same Greek family has returned to the space.

I was first seated at a table next to the window, but a couple of very loud Irish tourists made me want to ram bars of Irish Spring in their mouths. I took another seat further in where I sat next to an older couple who appeared to be satisfied regulars whom the daughters knew well. Their cordial attitude definitely extended toward me, an interloper in these parts, as I studied the menu which had some Greek dishes but mostly American plates with a Greek twist (photo: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Sw7J5L&amp;s=00e2b4f87fa96254feaa3fb01e23540d5e67418c271498caaaa653a36c74935e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1Sw7J5L</a>).

Instead of going full-on Greek with Spanakopita or Grilled Kofta, I ordered the $16 Panos Burger, a medium-rare half-pounder of ground lamb with all the expected Greek touches - feta, olive tapenade, tzatziki, cucumber, tomato and onion - along with a side of fries (photo: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1WtjOYo&amp;s=c9a2c9b4e2a35b64d8b7d61852f17d8ccd346b35bc3166172b8f993cee4a51dd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1WtjOYo</a>).

What a cute neighborhood with a plethora of humvee strollers carrying adorable babies and cuddly furbabies furiously plowing through the sidewalks of 24th street like it ain&#39;t no thang. <br><br>Yep, that will be me one day...once I win the lottery.<br><br>In a well to do neighborhood like Stroller Valley which Noe Valley is nicknamed, it&#39;s disappointing to find one mediocre restaurant after another. So when I heard that Novy was opening up in the former Pasta Pomodoro space, I was hoping that it would break the mediocre restaurant curse in this area. <br><br>Opening on March 16th, Novy serves Cal-Med-Mex food. The menu offers salads ($11-$15), pastas ($11-$14), wraps ($11-$12), quesadillas ($10) and burgers ($12-$13). Lunch and dinner menu is the same. Beer and wine only. <br><br>I don&#39;t like slamming new businesses but I think Novy would have benefited from having a soft opening to the public to elicit unbiased feedback instead of a private one where I&#39;m guessing all these 5 star reviews and professionally taken pics came from. Brunch items in those pics are not even on the current menu.<br><br>The food was less than mediocre and that&#39;s being nice. Considering the menu is very basic, it was disappointing how poorly and sloppily executed the food was; even for a newly open restaurant. It seems like no love or attention to detail was put into any of the dishes. <br><br>The Fried Calamari ($10) arrived lukewarm and drenched in oil: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1FzSH8I&amp;s=5e6afec7e640762264905c54b62a4ab9efa9d2f147b738510bedcb2f40fa9233"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1FzSH8I</a>. It was soggy, greasy, and some pieces didn&#39;t even have batter because it had fallen off. Some of the onions still had their peel intact.<br><br>Now, I don&#39;t mind paying $11 for a Chicken Souvlaki ($7-$8 elsewhere) with no sides but not when I make this at home and do a better job: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1EEinf8&amp;s=6fc4b898268ec68d7844b5ae0d128fac6d97a506d34ca72e887e5758e73ef448"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1EEinf8</a>. The souvlaki wasn&#39;t securely wrapped so upon picking up, all the contents fell out on the other end. The chicken was bland and very dry. The tzatziki tasted like plain greek yogurt (where&#39;s the lemon, dill, garlic?) and wasn&#39;t evenly distributed to moisten the dry chicken: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Cm8sO0&amp;s=4aa1eaea33a57ed27cd91826487052f26b8e5e77c97876a7cccc6cf02540bde4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1Cm8sO0</a>. It was thrown on the front portion of the wrap and there was just 3 tiny dices of tomatoes?! Sorry, but that&#39;s just being sloppy and careless. But I wasn&#39;t very surprised since one of my yelp friends, Esther A. visited several days prior and there was wax paper (from the unmelted cheese) left on her hubbie&#39;s burger: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Cm8LZt&amp;s=790ec3b5d938558ba7b8887b180027b7508346c5642ad73cb8868b84a696cbc3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1Cm8LZt</a>. <br><br>Mr. NSS ordered the Pork Souvlaki ($11). He took one bite and didn&#39;t touch the rest. He even declined a box to take it home. This a person who normally cleans his plate and mines, even if the food is mediocre which is saying something.<br><br>Service was fine, however we received our orders after several people who arrived after us. Do come with patience though as the food took a while (30 mins) even when the restaurant was less than 1/3rds filled. <br><br>We sat outside so I can&#39;t speak to the ambiance inside but bonus points for being dog-friendly in their outdoor seating area.  <br><br>But, c&#39;mon Stroller Valley, you can do better than this!",538,10,140

I really enjoyed the twist they gave on the hollandaise and the eggs were poached to perfection. With all of the benedicts, they also give you a side of roasted potatoes (these were equally as amazing--hot and crunchy). I couldn&#39;t taste the salmon too much because they only give you a single small slice for both benedict servings, but given that it&#39;s only $1 more than the classic benedict, I&#39;m not complaining too much.<br><br>Overall, the check came to $38 and I was thoroughly surprised.

Back in the day, 35 years ago, I used to work in Noe Valley and occasionally went to Panos Restaurant (an excellent Greek place) in this very spot. After some time, it closed ... and then sort of re-opened? Today I happened upon this place and when looking at the menu, was struck by their &#34;Panos burger.&#34; I figured no way could it be a coincidence, googled it--and sure enough--this is a family restaurant, passed down over three generations, currently run by two sisters ofd the same name. Wow, I never figured I&#39;d be visiting this place almost forty years later. The interior is much more &#34;contemporary,&#34; all hard surfaces, wood tables, a bit chilly, the wind blowing in from the open door--very different from the white tablecloth place I remember. No matter: the food--every single dish we ordered was dope. Killer. Off the chain deliciously insane. We got their halloumi with date spread, drizzled with spice and olive oil, with a lemon wedge. It was the stuff of dreams--the Cypriot version of Saganaki, a bit more chewy and homey, earthy. This place did it perfectly ... think paneer and you&#39;re home. We also got their Greek salad--pickled dried onions and cucumbers, red bell peppers, black olives, and feta, with bold red bursting with freshness tomatoes, drizzled in a Greek herb vinegar dressing. Tart and super refreshing. I was originally not in the mood for salad, given it was such a cold S.F. night, but since my husband wanted it, and oh man was it the right call. One of the best ever--simplicity turned golden. We got their Brussels sprouts with bacon, and initially I thought it might be too fried, but no it was again perfection; the perfect leftover begging for over easy eggs, and voila! You have breakfast--0charred with smiley bacon and crispy with flash fried outer leaves. Their Panos burger--ALL 100% lamb (not a bit of beef in there)m=, was truly one of the vest vest lamb burgers I&#39;ve ever had, a case where the dish is way more than the sum of its parts. This was no ordinary &#34;burger,&#34; where the chef simply assembles the burger, meat on a bun, and some veggies thrown on. Nope. This was a work of art, a symphonic balance of tzatziki, tomato, red onion, perfectly done medium meat, as requested atop the most airy flaky bun, not sure if it&#39;s freshly baked or where they source this heavenly pillow, but it was the best vehicle for this lamb&#39;s life--ever. It comes with fries--classic, not to be mucked with. The moussaka is again purity in motion: no beef, just lamb. Tried and true, the real Greek deal. Layers upon layers of eggplant and potato ... I was telling my husband that I think moussaka is the Italian version of lasagna, where each family has their own perfected version, and it&#39;s unfair to compare one to another. This is their own spin on the Panos family, and it&#39;s just fine, maybe could&#39;ve used a pinch more salt and sugar, but to each her own :-) The service was warm, attentive, super friendly from each person, the server, the person who bought our plates, the person who bought our boxes, everyone was phenomenal. The prices are terrific, especially for the generous portions and excellent execution. If I lived in the area, it would be a go to neighborhood spot for us. But we&#39;ll be making the trek from the peninsula.",538,10,150

Good Greek food in the city that&#39;s not mass made for a lunch line is tough to come by in San Francisco. With Novy - we have the answer we&#39;ve been searching for. We&#39;ve been here two times now; both times the meals were fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing. <br><br>The first time we went, we split the Greek salad, the Lamb Kofta and the Red Snapper with Polenta. &#34;Pow!&#34; is the word I would use to describe the burst of fresh flavors, crispy veggies and tart combo of vinegar and mint in the dressing. This salad was perfectly dressed and skipped the lettuce, which was nice. Instead of a bunch of filler lettuce, we got hearty slices of fresh heirloom tomatoes, crisp cucumber, home-pickled pepperocinis and creamy feta. Yum. <br><br>Then for our mains we split the lamb kofta which is served with tabbouleh salad and a mint tzatziki sauce. The lamb was well done, packed with herbs and seasonings. The mint sauce served as a nice balance between the deep flavors of the lamb kofta (which is basically like a meatball.)<br><br>The other dish which I highly recommend is the red snapper. The snapper was lightly battered and super moist. The polenta cakes it was served with were unbelievably creamy and light. The fish and polenta together melted in my mouth like butter. This is a must-try. <br><br>We finished our meal with a custard berry parfait which had about 2 cups of fresh berries and the slightest hint of brandy. It was sooth and definitely satisfied the sweet tooth.<br><br>We went this Sunday for lunch to try the burgers. I had the California burger with a turkey patty. The homemade Greek Goddess dressing combined with thinly sliced avocado, lightly marinated mushrooms and beefsteak tomato slice were the perfect combo. It was juicy, flavorful and filling! I&#39;m craving it again just writing about it. <br><br>In addition to the amazing food, the staff is super friendly. They are quick to seat you, very attentive to your needs and greet everyone with a smile. The atmosphere is sleek - air plants decorate the walls and horizontal wood paneling create a feeling of a cool cellar spot. Definitely recommend!",538,10,290

I really do. It is just a couple of blocks from my house. But I have now been there three times and every single time the staff has treated me like I am a nuisance. Today was just the latest example. The place was busy at lunch and I asked for a table inside and the guy said it would be 30 minutes so I asked if I could put my name down and he said, &#34;we don&#39;t keep a list you just have to wait here.&#34; Um...OK, so I can&#39;t go shopping or come back, I just have to sit there. And he did not offer a drink or anything while waiting (which I would have happily PAID for had he offered). Then suddenly he can seat us in less than 5 minutes, so I am not sure what happened there. Was he just trying to get rid of us by telling us it would be 30 minutes even though we could all see that a table was paying up and about to be free? Then I got my lamb souvlaki which the menu says comes with tzatziki but there wasn&#39;t any on the plate. The lamb was dry so I flagged him down after a few minutes and asked for some sauce (I did not complain about the lamb) and he gave me a look and then went around and dug around in the ice machine for about five minutes while I could see the sauce sitting there, waiting to be brought to my table. Finally my table mate got up and asked him for it and he came over without a word and plopped it on the table without so much as a &#34;sorry about that&#34; (remember, according to the menu, it was supposed to come with the dish in the first place). I have worked in two different restaurants and the place was busy so I get that he was probably stressed. But if he had just treated us like paying customers instead of an inconvenient nuisance, if he had just said, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m really sorry. We are unexpectedly busy today and I know the service has not been the greatest,&#34; it would have gone a long way and we would have been forgiving. But he didn&#39;t. Arrogant, rude and by the way this is the THIRD time I have experienced this at Novy from multiple servers, which tells me this is a problem that is pervasive. I&#39;m done with this place.

After having several unsatisfying glasses of wine, I finally googled the bottles they offered, and discovered this markup. I sense they may be trying to get a big margin on the wine as folks don&#39;t catch it there (would be more obvious in food prices). I understand that restaurants have it tough with real estate/rent in SF, but other restaurants across the neighborhood and city manage to offer good wine at a fair price. Paying $12, even $15, per glass isn&#39;t a problem, but that&#39;s usually for a $30-40+ bottle. (The norm for restaurants is a 2.5-3x wholesale markup, which Novy is crazily beyond).

Brutal, non? Rigo left his position at Starbucks and decided to reopen some cafes, this time calling them La Boulangerie de San Francisco. Now there are 8 in SF and one in the East Bay, near Rockridge Bart. I was at this Noe Valley branch a few months ago and really liked their Americano - I think they do good coffee (it&#39;s from Equator in SF). Their soup was really good too, the avocado toast was OK and the pastries that I&#39;ve tried so far were all good - especially the apple chausson (turnover), which doesn&#39;t look that special but was really good, warmed up. The pastry selection varies by location and this Noe branch had a larger selection than the Rockridge branch, but for the most tempting pastry selection of all, check out the Pine branch! <br><br>I&#39;m giving La Boulangerie 4/5 &#34;green stars&#34; for social and environmental impact, based on this:<br><br>* Coffee, from Equator, is organic and fair trade.<br>* They make a fairly good effort to reduce waste - most items are eaten in-house with ceramics and metal utensils; Condiments like ketchup and mustard and jam come in a pot with a spoon rather than plastic sachets. <br>* A fairly high percentage of their food is plant-based. They make a vegan breakfast wrap using &#34;Just&#34; vegan egg. <br>* Their regular eggs are cage-free, but pasture-raised would be more ideal. Not that they are common in cafés. <br>* They serve organic bread with soups and salads but could incorporate more organic ingredients. <br>* They could do a better job at providing info (on the menu, website, or in stores) on food sourcing.<br><br>Interested in writing green star reviews?

My husband and I each had a la carte sandwiches. I had an amazing Croque Monsieur - Ham, swiss &amp; bechamel on toasted pain de me. It was to die for, like a grown up ham &amp; cheese sandwich. It was so gooey and indulgent and I will definitely come back for this. A la carte the sandwich was $6, but if you want a side of greens it&#39;ll be $9. My husband had a turkey sandwich from the display window that was $6.50. We shared chips for $2.50. Everything was very tasty, and I saw some salads going out to other customers that looked absolutely fantastic. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try those. They have huge water cups (probably 16 oz) and a nice jug from which you can self serve chilled water.<br><br>The best part - my husband and I got hooked on Krema Regal&#39;ad back on our honeymoon in French Polynesia. On our trip to France last year, we really stocked up and brought a lot home with us, but sadly they&#39;re all gone. La Boulangerie carries Kremas at the front counter!!! We&#39;ve looked all over the US for someone who carries these and have never found them outside of France or one of it&#39;s territories - unless of course we pay a ton of money to import them.

What I hope La Boulangerie realizes, though, is that increasing prices AND charging extra for items that used to be included is maybe doing too much at once.<br><br>- Fewer Condiments + More Restricted Menu Options -<br>They have recently cut back on what used to be a very robust condiment bar. No more olives, pickles, or Nutella. And you can no longer get fruit as a side dish, even though they still sell a fruit cup; you have to choose tater tots (kind of weird) or salad (and I&#39;m not a fan of the dressing). Additionally, you used to be able to choose whatever veggies you wanted for the egg scramble, but now you are restricted to one item from each category (so if you want two things from one category, and zero things from another category, you are out of luck). I hope La Boulangerie will restore its condiment bar and make the menu a little more versatile.<br><br>- Food Preparation -<br>At any restaurant, once in a while, the kitchen will make a mistake. But I have found that La Boulangerie mixes up my order more often than not. I&#39;m not sure why this is, but I hope they can smooth it out.<br><br>I love this little neighborhood gem and hope they can address some of these issues (I have heard others saying similar things).",107,10,60

I usually toast my bagels but it was fantastic fresh from the oven and a bit steamy.  I love that they have 3 selections of lox.  It seems to have a better display case and overall feel than their competitor down the street.  Downside:  they don&#39;t take credit card.  They take ATM or debit but will charge an extra dollar tacked on to your bill.  That&#39;s it for this review.  Definitely go here over Holey Bagel.  I just tried both and Noe Bagel wins hands-down!",117,10,110
